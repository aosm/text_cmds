.Sh NAME
.Nm split
.Nd split a file into pieces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar byte_count[k|m]
.Op Fl l Ar line_count
.Op Fl a Ar suffix_length
.Op Ar file Op Ar name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the given
.Ar file
(or standard input if no file is specified)
and breaks it up into files of, by default, 1000 lines each.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Create files
.Ar byte_count
bytes in length.
If
.Dq Li k
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.Ar byte_count
kilobyte pieces.
If
.Dq Li m
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.Ar byte_count
megabyte pieces.
.It Fl l
Create output files
.Ar n
lines in length.
.It Fl a
Use
.Ar suffix_length
letters to form the suffix portion of the filenames of the split file.
If -a is not specified, the default suffix length will be two. If the sum of the 
.Ar name
operand and the
.Ar suffix_length
option-argument would create a filename exceeding {NAME_MAX} bytes, an 
error will occur, and
.Nm
will exit with no output files having been created.
.El
.Pp
If additional arguments are specified, the first is used as the name
of the input file which is to be split. A
.Dq Li - 
character may be used as the first argument, to specify that
Standard Input is to be used.
If a second additional argument is specified, it is used as a prefix
for the names of the files into which the file is split.
In this case, each file into which the file is split is named by the
prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix in the range of 
.Dq Li aa-zz .
(If
.Ar suffix_length
is provided, the suffix will be created using the specified number of
characters, rather than the default of two characters.)
.Pp
If the
.Ar name
argument is not specified, the file is split into lexically ordered
files named in the range of
.Dq Li xaa-xzz .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v6 .
